c_arrays
========

Two and three dimensional static and dynamic arrays in C.

I have created this small set of C files to help one better understand multi-dimensional arrays in C. Note that if you use C++, that for the most part, these examples could be used as well. 

README.md
=========

This file.

Makefile
========

This is the makefile used to build the source in this repository.

array2.c
======

Statically initialized two-dimensional array.

array2d.c
=======

Dynamically initialized two-dimensional array.

array3.c
======

Statically initialized three-dimensional array.

array3d.c
=======

Dynamically initialized three-dimensional array.

Planned Enhancements:
=====================

1. Malloc version using two and three dimensional arrays (i.e. Versus stack definition).

2. Malloc version that obtain the number of arrays and bounds they contain using argc/argv in main.
